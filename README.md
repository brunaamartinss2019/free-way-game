# JS FREEWAY (Arcade Game Reconstruction)

Freeway is a fully JavaScript-developed game that hopes to bring back memories of a classic arcade title. It's a game based on the simple yet challenging traversal mechanics of the original game.

## Considerations
Although the gameplay is quite intuitive, here are some things that you might like to know before diving in:

## Scoring and Collision System

The system is straightforward. You, as the Chicken, must cross a ten-lane highway full of cars and trucks. The objective is to achieve the greatest number of successful crossings within a determined time limit. Whenever the Chicken completes the crossing, you earn one point, and the counter is reset, preparing for the next round.

However, for each collision against a car, the Chicken goes down one position, increasing the challenge of reaching the other side.
